# Classify Waste Products Using Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Transfer Learning** using the VGG16 model to classify waste products. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them, the project showcases a robust approach to automate waste classification, which can be utilized in industrial or municipal settings.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you will:
- Apply transfer learning for image classification using the VGG16 model.
- Prepare and preprocess image data for machine learning tasks.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model to improve accuracy.
- Evaluate the model's performance with appropriate metrics.
- Visualize model predictions on test data.

## Tasks
1. Print the TensorFlow version.
2. Create a `test_generator` using the `test_datagen` object.
3. Print the length of the `train_generator`.
4. Print the summary of the pre-trained model.
5. Compile the model.
6. Plot accuracy curves for training and validation sets using the Extract Features Model.
7. Plot loss curves for training and validation sets for the fine-tuned model.
8. Plot accuracy curves for the fine-tuned model.
9. Visualize a test image prediction using the Extract Features Model.
10. Visualize a test image prediction using the Fine-Tuned Model.
